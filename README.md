## bittle-walker
ROS package for Gazebo simulation for a bittle robot and gait generation in the future

# Current State:
- Working in gazebo
- Sliding behavior when trying to get up on legs
- need to fix contact point friction values
- joint control gui is available, but does not publish data to gazebo

# Dependencies:
- ROS Noetic on Ubuntu 20.04
- Not sure which packages are actually being used lmao
- just clone it and try to run `roslaunch quad_walker gazebo.launch` and see what crashes
-
